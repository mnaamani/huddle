  Huddle: Slack Team Meetings

## Sub-Heading ##

  Create an online meeting and invite team members from Slack to join.

## Summary ##

  Create an online meeting room, send invites to select members from your Slack team. Take attendance, send out alerts to missing memebers. When the team is assembled, start a video conference.

## Problem ##

  When hosting large online team meetings, do you struggle sending out invites by email or a meeting URL by chat? Are you sure the right people got the invite? Do you waste time trying to figure out who is missing, and hunting them down, and taking attendance. If yes than Huddle is here to help!

## Solution ##

  By integrating with slack web api, a meeting organiser can host a meeting online on Huddle then:

    1. Select Slack team members to invite. (The selection can be saved as a group for reuse.)
    2. Team members will get direct messages from the organiser in slack with a URL to join the meeting.
    3. Only invited users can join the meeting URL.
    4. The meeting automatically tracks attendance and can send alerts to remind  missing members to join.
    5. When tready, the organiser can begin the meeting.
